Revision history for mod_perl module Apache::Album.

0.93  Wed Apr 05 23:16:00 2000
	- Moved generation of small/med/large pictures to a cleanup
	  handler, makes the initial loading of a page much faster!
	- Added ?all_full_images=sm|med|lg|full which puts all the full
	  sized images on a single page. (Eats up bandwidth + memory so
	  be careful!)
	- Fixed parsing of .htaccess file + made recursive .htaccess of
	  previous directories accessible
	- Untaint user passed directory name so Album can be used with taint
	  turned on
	- Added NumberOfColumns setting if someone wants to specify that
	  instead of the approx browser width
0.92  Wed Dec 01 23:16:00 1999
        - Added Sm Med Lg tags if AllowFinalResize is set, this creates smaller
          versions of the pictures, for people with small screens and/or small
          bandwidth
        - Added ReverseDirs/ReversePics which if set reverses the sort order
          of directories/pictures
        - Added EditMode which if set allows the end user to create new albums
          and upload pictures
